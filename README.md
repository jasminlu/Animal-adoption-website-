# FINAL PROJECT for Web & Database Computing (2024 Semester 1)

Created by Georgia Mason, Maria Madakuzhy, Jasmin Lu, and Mansi Patel!

To test our webpage, type 'service mysql start', then 'npm start' in the terminal, while the Dev Container is running. Also make sure BCrypt and Nodemailer are both installed in the terminal. You will immediently see the main page of the website, and can then navigate to other html pages using the header, footer, or other buttons on each page. Each button is clearly labeled and written so the webpage is very accessible and easy to understand how to use!

IMPORTANT NOTE: We made our webpage with the SINGLE organisation approach.
