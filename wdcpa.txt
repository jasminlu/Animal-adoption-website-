HOW TO USE THE WDCPA DATABASE!
11 fun tables of information :D

1. When making queries or inserting information, make sure that you are putting in all the required variables into the table.
   If it has NOT NULL next the value it must be inputted! Unless it is dateTime or an AUTO_INCREMENT id. Otherwise, it will not work.
   To insert data directly by mysql the command is:
   INSERT INTO table_name
   VALUES (variable1, variable2, variable3);
   You can also choose some variables to input like this:
   INSERT INTO table_name(var1, var3, var5)
   VALUES (variable1, variable3, variable5),
   (variable1, variable3, variable5);

2. Want to add information to a variable that is a foreign key?
   Make sure to have a look at the relevant table and identify the id before adding!
   Example: For the user table there are two foreign keys for the position and location.
   Check the respective tables for the relevant id and simply input it in as normal.

3. Always back up the database after any changes using this command after exiting mysql:
   mysqldump --databases wdcpa > wdcpa.sql

4. The animalType, eventType, pos and location tables SHOULD NOT be edited.

NOTE: I have left the subscribe table empty so that you can test it with real emails. I have also left the rsvp table empty.
